Problem statement:

Write a program to transform frame A to frame B, then input position of a point in a frame and output position of the same point in another frame.

INPUT:

    1.  Angle(float) in degrees by which to rotate frame A about x-axis
    2.  Angle(float) in degrees by which to rotate frame A about y-axis
    3.  Angle(float) in degrees by which to rotate frame A about z-axis
    4.  Distance(float) in units by which to translate frame A about x-axis
    5.  Distance(float) in units by which to translate frame A about y-axis
    6.  Distance(float) in units by which to translate frame A about z-axis
    7.  Frame (character[A/B]) in which the known point lies
    8.  Coordinates (3 space-separated integers) of the known point

OUTPUT:

    1. (numpy array) new coordinates
